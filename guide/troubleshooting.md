# Running Windows on the LG V50

## Troubleshooting Issues
> Below you will find a list of common problems and their solutions

## Cannot mount Windows in Android
If mounting Windows produces an empty folder, you either don't have Windows installed, or your rom does not have mount support.

Solution: Install **LineageOS 20**

## Cannot write to Windows in Android
> This is caused by shutting down Windows instead of restarting it.
- To solve this, boot to Windows and then press "restart", then as the screen shuts off boot to fastboot and flash your Android boot image.
- Or, disable hibernation in Windows using [this](https://github.com/n00b69/woa-beryllium/releases/tag/1.0) script.
> Alternatively, if you have already set up the Switch to Android app, simply use this to switch to Android.
